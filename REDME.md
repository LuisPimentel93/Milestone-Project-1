I have developed a tic taco toe game that I have based on my two daughter, AVA and Araceli. instead of having Xs and Os on the board. we have Ava and Ara as the choice and first move will start with Ava.  the winning combination will change colors and the tic tac toe at the top will change and say someone have won. if no  winner it will say that its a draw.
